# CITS4403 Project – Fire Evacuation Simulation

## Overview
Agent-based simulation of people evacuating a building during a fire with smoke propagation and visibility effects.  
Built for **CITS4403 Computational Modelling** at UWA.

## Repo Structure
- `src/` – main source code (agents, environment, simulation loop).
- `utils/` – helper functions (plotting, config parsing, pathfinding).
- `data/` – floorplans, sample datasets, configuration files.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experiments, analysis, and visualisations.
- `requirements.txt` – list of Python dependencies.
- `README.md` – project overview and instructions.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cits4403-evacuation-simulation.git
cd cits4403-evacuation-simulation
